= Windows Containers

Windows Container Support for OpenShift provides support for running
Microsoft Windows Server containers on OpenShift Container Platform. For
those that administer environments with a mix of Linux and Windows
workloads, OpenShift allows you to deploy containerized Windows workloads
running on Windows Server on the same platfrom as your containerized Linux workloads.

Windows container workloads are supported for clusters running on the
following providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* VMware vSphere
* Bare Metal (via link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/windows_containers/byoh-windows-instance.html[BYOH])

NOTE: For more information  about what versions of Windows Server are supported, please see the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/windows_containers/understanding-windows-container-workloads.html[official documentation].

In this lab, you'll get hands on experence on how to deploy a Windows
worker node and how to deploy workloads onto an OpenShift platform with
Windows and Linux nodes.

== Windows MachineConfig Operator

The Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) is the entry point for
OpenShift Administrators who want to run containerized Windows workloads
on their clusters.

It allows Cluster Administrators to add a Windows worker nodes as a day 2
operation with a prescribed configuration to an OpenShift cluster and
enable scheduling of Windows workloads.

The following diagram is a high level illustration on how the WMCO works.

The Windows Machine Config Operator is a Linux-based operator that runs on
Linux-based nodes on OpenShift. It watches for Machine Objects that are
of type Windows and connects to them over SSH.

During setup, the WMCO will:

* Transfer needed binaries to the Windows node.
* Installs and confiugres the Kubelet.
* Install and run it's own overlay network (Hybrid-overlay network).
* Confiugre the CNI on the Kubelet.
* Set up kube-proxy.

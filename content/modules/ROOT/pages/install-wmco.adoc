= Installing the WMCO

Before you can deploy a Windows Node, you will need to install the Windows
Machine Config Operator (WMCO). This can be done via the OpenShift Web
Console. Use the "Console" tab, or open the console in another tab if it isn't open already.

Back on the cli, you should now see the WMCO pod running.

[source,bash,role="execute"]

oc get pods -n openshift-windows-machine-config-operator

The output should look something like this.

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

Once the operator is up and running. You are ready to install a Windows Node.
